this project is about making a clone of an airbnb app simulating real world production environment. this project will take us on a journey of full-stack development

#Team Roles
Backend developer: engineers and stabilizes the product
software architect: designs a high-level software architecture
DevOps engineer: facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
#Technology Stack
some technologies to be used are Django to manage the database and postgresql as database.
#Database Design

id: Unique identifier for each property

title: Name of the property listing

description: Detailed description of the property

location: Address or city of the property

price_per_night: Cost to book the property per night

host_id: Foreign key linking to the user who owns the property

3. Bookings

id: Unique identifier for each booking

user_id: Foreign key linking to the user who made the booking

property_id: Foreign key linking to the property being booked

check_in: Date of arrival

check_out: Date of departure

status: Booking status (pending, confirmed, canceled)

4. Reviews

id: Unique identifier for each review

user_id: Foreign key linking to the reviewer (guest)

property_id: Foreign key linking to the reviewed property

rating: Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5)

comment: Text feedback left by the guest

5. Payments

id: Unique identifier for each payment

booking_id: Foreign key linking to the associated booking

amount: Total amount paid

payment_method: Payment type (credit card, PayPal, etc.)

status: Payment status (pending, completed, failed)
Relationships

A User can act as a Host (who lists properties) or as a Guest (who books properties).

A User can have multiple Properties (one-to-many).

A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many).

A Booking belongs to one User (guest) and one Property.

A Booking can have one associated Payment (one-to-one).

A Property can have multiple Reviews, and each Review is written by one User.
#Feature Breakdown

1. User Management

Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature allows guests to book properties and hosts to list and manage their properties securely. It ensures that all user data, including authentication, is handled safely.

2. Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with details like title, description, location, price, and images. This feature allows guests to browse available properties and helps hosts showcase their offerings effectively.

3. Booking System

Guests can make bookings for available properties, specifying check-in and check-out dates. The system tracks booking status (pending, confirmed, or canceled), ensuring smooth reservation management and preventing double bookings.

4. Review System

Guests can leave ratings and comments on properties they have stayed in. This feature builds trust and helps future users make informed booking decisions by providing feedback on the property and host.

5. Payment Processing

Payments are securely handled for each booking, supporting multiple payment methods and tracking payment status (completed, pending, or failed). This ensures hosts are compensated and guests can book properties with confidence.
#API Security
Ensuring the security of backend APIs is critical in a web application like the Airbnb Clone, where sensitive user information and payment data are handled. The following key security measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication

Users are required to securely log in using tokens or session-based authentication. This prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and ensures that only verified users can interact with the system.

2. Authorization

Access to certain endpoints is restricted based on user roles, such as guests, hosts, or admins. This prevents users from performing actions they are not allowed to, such as editing or deleting other users’ property listings or bookings.

3. Rate Limiting

API requests are limited to prevent abuse and protect the backend from potential denial-of-service attacks. This ensures the application remains available and responsive for all legitimate users.

4. Data Protection

Sensitive data, including passwords and payment information, is encrypted and stored securely. This protects user privacy and reduces the risk of data breaches.

5. Input Validation and Sanitization

All inputs from users are validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

Implementing these measures ensures that user data is protected, transactions remain secure, and the platform operates reliably and safely for all participants.
#CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. They ensure that every change made to the codebase is automatically tested and validated before being released, reducing errors and speeding up development.

For the Airbnb Clone project, implementing a CI/CD pipeline helps maintain a reliable backend API and front-end application, enabling rapid iterations while keeping the platform stable.

Common tools that can be used include:

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment directly from your GitHub repository.

Docker: Creates consistent development and production environments for smooth deployment.

CI/CD Services: Platforms like CircleCI or Jenkins can also manage automated builds, tests, and deployments.

By integrating a CI/CD pipeline, developers can ensure code quality, reduce manual errors, and deliver new features and bug fixes more efficiently.
